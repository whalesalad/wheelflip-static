BEGIN

While our primary business has shifted focus towards wholesale rim half distribution, we still offer some wheel services. At this moment, we are using discretion in what we take on, but please do not hesitate to ask!

#### Replacement Lips & Barrels

Our main business is in the wholesale supply of custom lips and barrels. We can provide replacements and custom sizes for the majority of 3 piece wheels out there from 14" through 20". Please use the contact form to inquire.

#### Wheel Resizing

At this moment, we are only re-lipping and re-barreling modular wheels. That includes any wheel where the center can be unbolted. We are being selective on all 2pc. welded wheels and custom 1pc. to 2pc. conversions.

#### Custom Machine Work
